/// 
/// Signals a controlled short-circuit of the validation pipeline (Chain of Responsibility pattern).
///
/// This exception is an internal **control-flow marker** used to halt rule evaluation once a specific logical
/// `level` (defined by the [RuleSet] hierarchy) is reached. It is not a failure state, but a mechanism to
/// optimise processing when further validation is impossible or would result in meaningless issues.
///
/// The engine catches this signal and compares it against the current execution context to determine the unwinding depth.
/// A specialised sentinel, [#HALT], is provided to halt the entire demo.validation.
/// Any signal that does not match a [RuleSet #interrupt] in the current hierarchy will result in a full termination.
///
/// Throw the signal within a rule implementation to stop evaluation immediately upon reaching a decisive outcome.
