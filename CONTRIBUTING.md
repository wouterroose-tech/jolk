To establish **Industrial Sovereignty** over contributions, a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file serves as a legal and technical gateway. It ensures that any code submitted by the community automatically adheres to the **Apache License 2.0** terms, preventing "Intellectual Property Grit" from stalling the project's evolution.

### **Jolk Contribution Protocol**

The following structure ensures **Nominalised Precision** for all community interactions:

---

#### **1. Legal Foundation (Individual Contributor License Agreement)**

In accordance with Section 5 of the **Apache License 2.0**, any contribution submitted for inclusion in the **Jolk** project is governed by the project's license.

> **Statement of Intent**: By submitting a Pull Request, you acknowledge that your contribution is your original work and that you grant **Wouter Roose** and the Jolk community a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use, modify, and distribute that work under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License.

#### **2. Technical Sovereignty (Commit Standards)**

To maintain a clean **Mojo** history, all commits must follow the **Nominalised Commit** format:

* **`feat:`**: Introduction of a new grammar production or feature.
* **`fix:`**: Resolution of a parser bug or logic error.
* **`docs:`**: Updates to the manuscript or README.
* **`refactor:`**: Structural density improvements without functional changes.

#### **3. Submission Process**

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a sovereign copy of the Jolk codebase.
2. **Branch Creation**: Develop within a scoped branch (e.g., `feature/tolk-unary-optimisation`).
3. **Validation**: Ensure all `**` and `unary` tests pass the **Tolk Engine** verification suite.
4. **Pull Request**: Submit the request with a clear description of the architectural outcome.

### **Maintaining the Factory Pattern**

Contributions should focus on enhancing the **Lazy Meta Constant Lens Projection** and **Polymorphism** core to Jolk. We prioritize submissions that:

* Enhance **JVM Integration**.
* Refine the **Tolk Grammar** for improved LL(1) performance.
* Implement new **Mojo** message-passing optimisations.
